## Shell volume fractions (averaged from ACS Nano Marianna paper)
DSPC: 26 +- 4  = 0.26
Chol: 33 +- 3  = 0.33
MC3: 38 +- 7   = 0.38
PEG: 3 +- 0.5  = 0.03

## Dry core volume fractions (note molar fractions are 75:25 MC3:Chol)
Chol: 12 +- 1  = 0.12
MC3: 75 +- 1   = 0.75
mRNA: 13 +- 2  = 0.13


## SLD_neutron per component
MC3  = 0.09
Chol = 0.21 (hydrogenous; deuterated form is 1.4)
DSPC = 0.18 (hydrogenous; deuterated form is 6.7)
PEG  = ??? (0.62 was for PEG unit, DPME part was 0.31, need DMG)



## Monolayer-LNP models to consider

- Lipid exchange/addition to the monolayer
(1) DMG-PEG-2000 [up to 90:10]
(2) DLin-MC3-DMA
(3) Combination of lipids

- Material binding as a third layer
(1) PolyA (with MC3 inserted)
(2) PolyA (with PEG inserted at different polymer lengths (persistent length?))
(3) PolyA (with PEG and MC3 inserted)
(4) LNPs (for completion)

- Material merging between layers 3 and 2
(1) PolyA (with MC3 inserted)
(2) PolyA (with PEG inserted at different polymer lengths (persistent length?))
(3) PolyA (with PEG and MC3 inserted)


### calculate LNP SLD, make LNP and polyA (assumes LNP degrades) plots


## Jayne Email - RC comments
fully extended tail is irrelevant
only works if you negelcts the roughness, data from 90s had zero roughness therefore needed thicker layers (length of layer and added air)



## September data
Only consider lengths proportional number of carbons, e.g. 3/15 of the carbons in this region
3/15 of what was fitted (12 angstroms)
-- count how many carbons

19 carbons from tail to connecting point
Therefore 18 on each tail
C18 has been fitted to 12 A
3/18 * 12 = 2 A.... but this is less than capillary wave roughness too small to resolve



## Setup next meeting
